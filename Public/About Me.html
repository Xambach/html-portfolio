  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my Portfolio. This is the story of my journey which documents <br>the challenges 
    I have encountered while learning to become a full-stack developer. <br>
    A bit of background: I studied Graphic Design in University - twice, after which <br>
    I went into private practice for a good number of years. Although I found this fun <br>
    as I was doing what I had always loved to do, I had a lot of limitations. These ranged <br>
    from lacking the aptitude to upscale in other skills such as coding and Motion Graphics
    to 3D and Industrial Design.
  </p>
  <p>Recently however, I decided to face my fears and therefore took up the challenge to learn
    Maya. I found it wasn't as hard as I'd feared, probably because I immediately<br>
    fell in love with hard surface modeling once I waded through online portfolios of <br>
    of incredible work by talented artists, some of whom had a similar background to mine. <br>
